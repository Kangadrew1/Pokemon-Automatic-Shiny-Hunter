# Pokemon-Automatic-Shiny-Hunter
Lore: It began for a GT project in Prototyping Intelligent Devices. The quest was automating the process of catching shiny pokémon in Nintendo DS games.

Project owners: Andrew Nguyen and Edmund Chen.

Our development purposes are for the 3DS pokémon games—or likewise compatible—and generations above, using an arduino as the MCU (ATMega 2560).
